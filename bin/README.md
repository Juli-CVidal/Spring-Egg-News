#### It is based on a small news portal, where accounts are used to interact with it.

### There are three types of accounts:
* #### The user can only view news.
* #### The journalist can view, create and modify news
* #### The administrator can create, view and modify news, as well as dismiss journalists.

## Requirements
- [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `main.java.com.egg.news.newsApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
